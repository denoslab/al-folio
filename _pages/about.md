The **D**istributed **E**dge Lear**N**ing and **O**rchestration **S**ystems Lab was founded in 2021 by [Dr. Steve Drew](https://grad.ucalgary.ca/future-students/supervisor/steve-drew). DENOS Lab has the following research priorities:

##### Federated Learning
We vision that distributed learning systems (DLS) will be ubiquitously deployed in future edge computing systems. DLS supports large-scale data-driven decision-making, monitoring, and recommendation systems. Our application scenarios include connected autonomous vehicles (CAVs), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and industrial Internet of Things (IIoTs). The distributed systems are based on federated learning technology aiming at reducing communication costs and preserving privacy.

##### Fair Distributed Machine Learning
The deployments of edge computing systems have been growing rapidly. Our research areas in edge computing include resource allocation, task scheduling, placement decision-making, and availability assurance.

##### Federated Learning Systems in Healthcare

With our solid industrial backgrounds, we pay close attention to production-grade cloud and edge computing orchestration. We combine our research with Kubernetes-compatible systems running on both cloud and edge environments. Our research includes edge-based resource allocation and placement, privacy protection, service scaling and recovery, and high-availability edge application deployment.

##### Cloud, Edge, and Sky Computing for ML
