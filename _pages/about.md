The **D**istributed **E**dge Lear**N**ing and **O**rchestration **S**ystems Lab was founded in 2021 by [Dr. Steve Drew](https://grad.ucalgary.ca/future-students/supervisor/steve-drew). DENOS Lab has the following research priorities:

##### Federated Learning for Edge Service Orchestration

With federated learning (FL) systems gaining wider adoption for privacy-preserving machine learning in such a a mixture of infrastructure, the heterogeneity is expected to cause lowered performance of the trained models with longer convergence time, leading to excessive energy consumption for both the cloud infrastructure and battery-powered edge IoT devices. Can carefully designed FL methods guide cloud-edge service orchestration to tackle these challenges? Our vision is to develop resilient, sustainable, and privacy-preserving distributed machine learning methods with the outlook of broader adoption of learning from distributed data repositories. Inspired by the challenge of computing node availability, we want to answer the research question with three significant new components that distinguish it from existing studies: novel models that dynamically budget FL client participation based on availability and carbon footprints from FL, innovative algorithms for FL task replication with minimal impact of data privacy and an original prototype service orchestration scheduler for evaluating the proposed methods in actual cloud-edge service orchestration.

##### Federated Learning for Electrical Health Records (EHRs)

Federated learning can be valuable for training machine learning models on electronic health records (EHR) data while preserving patient privacy and complying with regulatory requirements like HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act). We aim to develop novel methods and prototypes. to address key challenges for better utilizing the knowledge from EHRs, including missing data, interoperability, and fairness.
