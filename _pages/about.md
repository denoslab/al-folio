The **D**istributed **E**dge Lear**N**ing and **O**rchestration **S**ystems Lab was founded in 2021 by [Dr. Steve Drew](https://grad.ucalgary.ca/future-students/supervisor/steve-drew). DENOS Lab has the following research prioroties:

##### Distributed learning systems
We vision that distributed learning systems (DLS) will be ubiquitously deployed in future edge computing systems. DLS supports large-scale data-driven decision making, mornitoring, and recomendation systems. Our application scenarios include connected automomous vehicles (CAVs), augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and industrial Internet of things (IIoTs). The distributed systems are based on federated learning technology aiming at reducing communication cost and preserving privacy.

##### Container orchestration systems and AIOps

With our root from the industry, we pay close attention to production-grade cloud and edge computing orchestration. We combine our research with Kubernetes-compatible systems running on both cloud and edge environement. Our research includes edge-based resource allocation and placement, privacy protection, service scaling and recovery, and edge appication deployment with high availablity.

##### Blockchain technology for privacy protection

Our lab is experience in blockchain research and crytocurrency asset management. We leverage blockchain technology for the dicentralization of data aggregation service in federated learning.
