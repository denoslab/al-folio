My research group teamed up with Illidan Lab at Michigan State University and won the [3rd place](https://drivendata.co/blog/federated-learning-pets-prize-winners-phases-2-3) in the [U.S. Privacy-enhancing Technologies Prize Challenge](https://petsprizechallenges.com/). Our solution based on a secure federated learning method was [profiled at the second Summit for Democracy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8nRs3VArnco&t=12544s), convened by U.S. President Joe Biden in March 2023. Congratulation, Fan Dong!
