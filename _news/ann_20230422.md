Three of my graduate students teamed up and won the [3rd place](https://devpost.com/software/news-guardian) of the [CANIS Hackathon for Data Visualization](https://canis-hackathon.devpost.com/). Congratulations, Leo, Yunkai, and Jiajun! It was an incredible opportunity for my students to work with misinformation data and explore new techniques. I want to thank Schulich Ignite for organizing this fantastic event.
